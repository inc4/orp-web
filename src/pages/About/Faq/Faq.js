          What is ORP?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The Open Reforestation Protocol (ORP) is an open-source digital platform for building, coordinating, and certifying carbon sequestration initiatives.  ORP connects reforestation practitioners with investors,  technology integrators, and entrepreneurs in a decentralized economy.  ORP is the first and only decentralized reforestation marketplace with standardized MRV methodologies and the capacity to mint data-backed carbon credits.

          How does ORP work?
        </h4>
        <p>
          ORP is a technical solution for monitoring, reporting, and verifying reforestation projects.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a project launches on ORP, they must source collateral from a group of decentralized collateral providers.

        </p>
        <p>
          Only once funding has legitimized a project, is the project allowed to upload data onto the protocol.
        </p>
        <p>

          This data is then sent to a decentralized community of validators who stake on the validity of that data.

        </p>
        <p>
          Once project data is verified, it is stored on a distributed ledger, disincentivizing bad actors from uploading false data (as they are likely to be weeded out by validator audits over time).
        </p>
        <p>
          This improved data transparency helps investors make smart decisions regarding which projects to put their money behind.  It also helps the project operators, who can attract investors by proving the integrity of their reforestation efforts.  At the international level, governments hoping to mitigate climate change can be sure that the trees they hope to plant will stay planted.  Notably, the blockchain data structure for handling project MRV data allows for direct accounting of carbon sequestration, solving long standing issues related to improper reporting and double-counting of carbon credits.

          Who is ORP built for?
        </h4>
        <p>
          ORP is built for anyone who wants to start, invest or be involved in carbon sequestration initiatives through the planting of trees (and eventually other nature based sequestration initiatives). Individuals or organizations interested in starting reforestation projects can use ORP to manage their projects and secure funding from green capital around the globe.
        </p>
        <p>
          Investors can easily find and support reforestation projects and by using a stringent MRV system they can make sure that the projects are 100% legitimate and all the submitted information tracking their progress is correct.
        </p>
        <p>Companies who operate with sustainability in mind can sponsor reforestation projects and use the minted OCC tokens to offset their carbon footprint.</p>
        <p>Developers and Entrepreneurs can use the open-source nature of the protocol to create innovative solutions for carbon sequestration or the reforestation value chain.</p>
        <p>
          Tech providers can find a new market for their solution by integrating their services with the protocol (including satellite imagery, AI, drones) as a compliment to existing solutions. Last but not least, the general public will be given the opportunity to support reforestation projects, support the fight against climate change and make a return on investment for the effort.

          How do I get started?

        </h4>
        <p>
          Project operators who are already running a reforestation project or already possess a concrete plan for a future reforestation project, can create an account and download the Reforester app. Reforester is a one-stop shop for project operators planting trees to quickly and easily upload data about their project, track the status of their project, engage with other ecosystem participants like collateral providers and validators, and eventually yield Open Carbon Credits (OCC’s).

          Can I Integrate My Technology Into The Protocol?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Why, yes! As an open-source protocol, ORP can host any technology that assists in the completion of carbon sequestration projects, whether that be relating to data management, carbon sequestration measurement, or social tech solutions that help facilitate local participation in reforestation initiatives. Technology integrators must apply to the ORP DAO for their solution to be whitelisted on Reforester.  Foreseeable use cases involve satellite imagery, tree planting drones, and soil carbon calculators - as well as any future developments that might become industry standards.

          What is The ORP Token?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The ORP token is a utility and governance token on ORP and it exists for three purposes: First, ORP’s provides validators with the capacity to verify the veracity of data uploaded onto the protocol. Second, ORP tokens are used for governance rights on the ORP DAO. Third, ORP token holders participating in the management of the protocol are able to yield Open Carbon Credits from reforestation projects using ORP.

          What Are OCCs?
        </h4>
        <p>
          Open Carbon Credits (OCCs) are data-backed carbon credits sourced from reforestation projects on the protocol.  Carbon credits are minted in proportion to the data uploaded by a project over time.  The design of the protocol is such that 5% of every OCC minted is distributed out to ORP token holders.

          Why Is ORP Necessary?
        </h4>
        <p>
          The reforestation industry suffers from a number of efficiency roadblocks.  Information is siloed between reforestation initiatives, there is a lack of collaborative funding mechanisms, MRV methodologies are expensive and inconsistent, and there is a lack of standardization among existing carbon credit schemes.

          What is Reforester?

        </h4>
        <p>
          Reforester is an open-source application used on the Open Reforestation Protocol by project operators (OP) for uploading data, and managing reforestation projects over time. Reforester is a one-stop shop for project owners planting trees to quickly and easily upload data about their project, track the status of their project, and engage with other ecosystem participants (i.e. Collateral Providers and Validators). With Reforester new projects start by creating an account, connecting funds to a wallet, and minting an NFT. Existing and ongoing projects use the same application to track the status of their previous data uploads, the amount of collateral locked for upcoming phases, and the status of their NFT and any RCC’s generated therein.

          What Do Collateral Providers Do?

        </h4>
        <p>Collateral providers lock up DAI in a smart contract, as collateral vouching for the legitimacy of a reforestation project. Based upon the duration of time and stage of the project, a collateral provider is able to yield ORP tokens. With these tokens, they have access to validation windows, the ORP DAO as well as the capacity to yield carbon credits.</p>
